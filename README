# On Windows, the coincurve package from pip requires the MS Visual Studio C++ compiler to exist
# in order to compile the Wheel so as of now the project doesn't support Windows (I use Ubuntu). 
# 
# I did get it running on Windows using WSL2 , but the search rate seemed much slower than I expected
# so I suspect something inefficient is happening when running on WSL2, so I don't recommmend going this
# route either

# install required packages
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# start searching!
python search_synth_ga.py
